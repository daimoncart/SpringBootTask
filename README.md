# SpringBootTask
This is a test project for some of the Spring Boot functionality
# Description
This one is about a non-existing company TowerMaster. Their employees climb towers all over the world, and the only thing they care about is wind speed and visibility. So the application requests OpenWeatherAPI data and filters out the data employees need.
# Build Status
Sort of finished, but functionality still can be added. 
# Tech/framework used
This application was built using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
